# React WP Gutenberg Curvy Block

This project is part of a Udemy course that focuses on building a custom Gutenberg block called **Curvy Block** for WordPress. The block allows users to add customizable SVG curves to their WordPress posts and pages using the Gutenberg editor.

## Project Overview

The **Curvy Block** is developed using React and integrated into WordPress's Gutenberg editor. It provides a flexible UI with customizable attributes such as height, width, colors, and SVG flipping options. Additionally, it allows users to implement curves both at the top and bottom of a block, with inner block support for dynamic content placement.

## Features

- **Side Panel Controls**: Customize the blockâ€™s attributes from the side panel.
- **Customizable SVG Curves**: Adjust the height, width, and colors of the curves.
- **Flip Controls**: Flip the SVG curve horizontally or vertically.
- **Color Picker**: Choose a custom color for the SVG curve.
- **Inner Blocks Support**: Add dynamic content inside the Curvy Block.
- **Frontend Rendering**: Dynamic rendering of the block and curves in the frontend.
